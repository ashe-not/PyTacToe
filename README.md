# PyTacToe
Tic tac toe GUI game made in python with the Tkinter module

# How it works
PyTacToe is just like any tic tac toe match you haver ever played. There is a 3 by 3 grid and you have to use X's or O's to score points.

There is just one twist: the 4 by 4 mode. Although still being developed the 4 by 4 mode will work as follows:

Just like regular tic tac toe, you have a grid and you use X's and O's to score points. However, in the four by four mode, that grid will have 16 spaces, instead of just 9 in the regular mode. In this four by four grid, players have two options: score one point by getting three consecutive X's or O's, or win the entire game instantly by getting four consecutive X's or O's. If none of the players get a consecutive four, the script checks to see who get more points and gives the victory to whoever got more points. The points are reset once someone wins.

# How to run it
For now, there is no release, as I still have to compile it. However, if you want to run it yourself, just clone this repository and run menu.py inside of src. this will start the menu (duh).
